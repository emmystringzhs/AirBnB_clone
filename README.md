# AirBnB Clone Project

This project aims to create an AirBnB clone, providing a platform for property rental, booking, and management. The project includes a command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with the system, facilitating tasks such as listing properties, booking accommodations, and managing bookings.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter allows users to manage AirBnB objects through a series of commands entered into the terminal. Below are instructions on how to start and use the command interpreter.

### How to Start

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

### How to Use

1. Run the command interpreter script by executing the following command:
   ```
   python airbnb_cli.py
   ```
2. You will be prompted with a command-line interface with the prompt `AirBnB>`.
3. Enter commands to perform various operations related to property rental, booking, and management.

### Examples

- **List Properties**: To list all available properties, enter the command:
  ```
  list_properties
  ```

- **Book Property**: To book a property, enter the command followed by the property ID:
  ```
  book_property <property_id>
  ```

- **Quit**: To exit the command interpreter, enter the command:
  ```
  quit
  ```

These are just a few examples of commands you can use with the command interpreter. Refer to the documentation or help messages within the CLI for a full list of available commands and their usage instructions.
